# Glossary Bot
This is a simple web app designed to be used as a [Slack integration](https://slack.com/integrations). Specifically, it responds to POSTs created by the Slack *Slash Commands* integration and responds with messages to Slack's *Incoming Webhooks* integration.

Glossary Bot maintains a glossary of terms created by its users, and responds to requests with definitions.

#### Requirements
Glossary Bot is written in Python and is known to work with version 2.7.  It will not run as written with Python versions 3.3.

#### Install
Glossary Bot is a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) app built to run on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/).

To install locally, clone this repository and cd into the resulting directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:codeforamerica/glossary-bot.git
cd glossary-bot
```

Set up and activate a new virtual environment using [Virtualenv](https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Python-Virtualenv.md):

```
virtualenv venv-glossary-bot
```
If your system has multiple versions of Python installed, you can use the -p option to specify the Python binary it should run with:
```
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv-glossary-bot
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```
source venv-glossary-bot/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages with pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create the production [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/PostgreSQL.md) database:

```
createdb glossary-bot
```

Copy `env.sample` to `.env` and make sure that the value of `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` matches the name of the database you created in the last step:

```
cp env.sample .env
```

Initialize the database:

```
python manage.py createdb
```

And run the application:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

#### Test
To run the app's tests, first create a test database. Make sure the name of the database matches the value of `environ['DATABASE_URL']` set in the `setUp()` function in [test/test_bot.py](https://github.com/codeforamerica/glossary-bot/blob/master/tests/test_bot.py):

```
createdb glossary-bot-test
```

You can now run the tests from the command line:

```
python manage.py runtests
```

or run an individual test:

```
python tests/test_bot.py BotTestCase.test_get_definition
```

#### Set Up on Slack

Glossary Bot uses two Slack integrations: [Slash Commands](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands) for private communication between the bot and the user, and [Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks) for posting public messages.

[Set up a Slash Command integration](https://my.slack.com/services/new/slash-commands). There are three critical values that you need to set or save: **Command** is the command people on slack will use to communicate with the bot. We use `/gloss`. **URL** is the public URL where the bot will live; you can fill this in after you've deployed the application to Heroku, as described below. **Token** is used to authenticate communication between Slack and the bot; save this value for when you're setting up the bot on Heroku.

[Set up an Incoming Webhooks integration](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook). The two important values here are: **Post to Channel**, which is a default channel where public messages from the bot will appear. This default is always overridden by the bot, but you do need to have one – we created a new channel called *#testing-glossary-bot* for this purpose. Save the value of **Webhook URL**; this is the URL that the bot will POST public messages to, and you'll need it when setting up Gloss Bot on Heroku.

#### Deploy on Heroku

Now it's time to deploy the bot to Heroku! First, make sure you've got the basics set up by following [Heroku's instructions for getting started with Python](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python-o).

Now, create a new Heroku application with a unique name:

```
heroku create my-glossary-bot
```

When you deploy your app, it'll be reachable at a URL like [https://my-glossary-bot.herokuapp.com/](#). Enter this URL into the **URL** field of the Slash Commands integration on Slack. See the [Heroku documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python-o#deploy-your-application-to-heroku) for more configuration options.

To give the bot everything it needs to communicate with Slack, set the config variables you saved when you set up the Slack integrations above. The **Token** from the Slash Command integration:

```
heroku config:set SLACK_TOKEN=1234567890
```

and the **Webhook URL** from the Incoming Webhooks integration:

```
heroku config:set SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/1234567/1234567/1234567890
```

You can also set these variables in the Heroku web interface.

Now run a git push to deploy the application:

```
git push heroku master
```
And you're good to get glossing!

#### Upgrade on Heroku

You've got an older version of Gloss Bot on Heroku and want to upgrade to the latest version. First, guarantee that you've got a backup of your database by following the instructions in [Heroku's PGBackups documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-backups).

Now, do a `git pull` in your local glossbot directory:

```
git pull
```

And deploy it to Heroku:

```
git push heroku master
```

You may need to run database migrations to get your database current with the new version:

```
heroku run python manage.py db upgrade
```

If you get errors when you try that, you may need to stamp your database with a revision id that matches its current state. You can check whether that's the problem by connecting to your remote database:

```
heroku pg:psql
```

And in `psql`, checking for the `alembic_version` table:

```
SELECT * FROM alembic_version;
```

If that gives you an error like `ERROR:  relation "alembic_version" does not exist` then you need to create that table. First type `\q` to leave `psql`, then run this heroku command:

```
heroku run python manage.py db stamp 578b43a08697
```

That will create the `alembic_version` table and give it a value for `version_num` of `578b43a08697`, which matches [the inital database migration](https://github.com/codeforamerica/glossary-bot/blob/master/migrations/versions/578b43a08697_initial_migration.py) for the application.

Now that you've done that, you should be able to run

```
heroku run python manage.py db upgrade
```

without errors.
